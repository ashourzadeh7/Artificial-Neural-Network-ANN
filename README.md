# Artificial-Neural-Network-ANN


# Backpropagation training algorithm for multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP) for training and testing iris data:

# Neural Network Topology:
In this model, there is a three-layer MLP network (input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer). The number of neurons in the hidden layer is considered equal to 10
according to trial and error. The activity function of the hidden layers and the bipolar sigmoid output are adopted. Also, the value of the learning rate (Alpha) and the
number of iterations are equal to 0.01 and 25, respectively.

# Neural network training with iris flower data:
In this model, 80% of the data are used for training and 20% for testing (data selection is random). The stopping condition of the algorithm is to reach the maximum
number of rounds in training.

# Neural network test with iris data:
We have tested the network with test data. We have considered the final output of the neural network for all neurons, and we have chosen any neuron with a larger value
as the output class. The best recorded result shows a test accuracy rate of 96.67%.

Notice: The obtained results can be seen in the Result folder. We have trained the network for different parameters and the best results are marked as Best.
